[b][size=4]Description[/size][/b]
[size=3]Using Invisibility now changes the way you view the world. Instead of only becoming transparent, you see through an ethereal lens that warps and twists the environment around you. Daedra and Undead appear differently, making them distinct from other creatures around you. Please watch the video to see exactly how the new visual effects work.
[/size]
[size=3]This mod is inspired by the visual effects of Frodo's ring in The Lord of the Rings movies. 
[/size]
[size=3]This mod does not use an ESP. This mod IS NOT compatible with OpenMW, at least until support for MWSE mods is added.[/size]
