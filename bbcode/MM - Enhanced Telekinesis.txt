Requirements[/b][/size]
- Morrowind
- Tribunal
- Bloodmoon
- MGE XE 0.10.1
- MWSE 2.1+

This mod requires the most recently nightly build of MWSE. Please be sure to run the mwse-update.exe before playing this mod. If your MWSE build is not from January 12, 2020 or newer, you will receive errors.

[size=3][b]Description[/b][/size]
Inspired by Fliggerty's Better Telekinesis, using telekinesis will now propel objects towards you with special effects instead of immediately picking the item up. Once they reach a certain distance from you, they will automatically be picked up. Items than cannot be picked up (beds, doors, etc.) and owned books will not use this new mechanic.

If you change cells while an item is being moved towards you, or under certain other conditions, the item will be returned to it's original location.

This mod is provided via a BAIN installer consisting of 2 components:
00 - Core
[list]
[*] The base mod. This includes the new mechanic and VFX. This is required.
[/list]01 - Cast VFX
[list]
[*] Additional VFX. This includes more VFX that replace the default hit and casting VFX for the telekinesis effects. This is optional.
[/list]
This mod does not use an ESP. This mod IS NOT compatible with OpenMW, at least until support for MWSE mods is added.

- EJ-12 for his help and advice on particles and meshes, and creating mipmaps for some textures.
- Arkann : this mod uses casting and hit vfx from Magic Diversity as they look better than vanilla. In the future there will be new more matching vfx for these too.
