By: OperatorJack, Kurpulio and Greatness7


==============
Requirements
==============
- Morrowind
- Tribunal
- Bloodmoon
- MGE XE 0.10.1
- MWSE 2.1+
- Magicka Expanded 1.31+

This mod requires the most recently nightly build of MWSE. Please be sure to run the mwse-update.exe before playing this mod. If your MWSE build is not from March 1, 2020 or newer, you will receive errors.

This mod requires the Magicka Expanded base package, version 1.31 or newer.

==============
Description
==============
The light magic effect has been replaced with a Skyrim-style magelight effect. Using the new magelight effect creates an orb of light that will follow and float around you and other actors. Casting the magelight on a target location will create an orb of light at the location for the duration of the spell. The intensity of the light depends on the magnitude of the spell. You can create new spells and enchantments with the new magelight effect, as well as use it on existing spells and enchantments. Each time the game is started, all usage of the vanilla light effect will be replaced with the new magelight, making this mod fully compatible with any mods that add light-based spells or enchantments. Watch the video for a full demonstration of the new mechanics!

Please be aware that there may be some lighting issues that occur on a rare occasion. This can be due to constraints in the vanilla light engine or issues with meshes. You can safely ignore these lighting issues.

This mod does use an ESP. This mod IS NOT compatible with OpenMW, at least until support for MWSE mods is added.

MWSE-Lua code may be used for any purpose for Morrowind. Please do not use it for other games. Please credit OperatorJack as the original author of any code.
Otherwise, this mod or its contents may not be used without contacting the authors first. This was a team effort. Please contact us before using a given resource. 

==============
Installation
==============
Use a mod management tool to install the mod.

It is not recommended to use PPL (pixel per lighting) in MGE XE with this mod as it can cause lighting issues. If you use PPL, alternate VFX files are included; see below. To disable it, open MGE XE, and in "distant land" tab, uncheck PPL.

For players with low PC who have fps problem with original VFX, there is a more performance friendly VFX (without particles)

This mod is provided via a BAIN installer consisting of 3 components: 
00 - Core files
* This component is required.
01 - Optional PPL
* VFX files for PPL users. Install in addition to core, if needed.
02 - Optional FPS
* For older computers, if you experience lighting or FPS issues. Install in addition to core, if needed.
