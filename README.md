# Magic Mechanics
The Magic Mechanics mod series is a collection of mods that expand, improve, and alter the vanilla Morrowind magic system in various ways. Mods in this series start with the abbreviation "MM" in their titles.

The mod series is made up of the following authors:
- [OperatorJack](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/users/61791411)
- Kurpulio
- [RedFurryDemon](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/users/46908543)

The mod series currently consists of the following mods:

## [MM - Cast-On-Swing Enchantments](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47338)
Another entry in the Magic Mechanics mod series, weapons with enchantments of Cast-On-Strike and Cast-On-Use types will now work without hitting a target. Just swing your weapon and the enchantment will work as normal, sending a spell projectile towards your target.

## [MM - Homing Projectiles](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47403)
Another entry in the Magic Mechanics mod series, adds the ability to control spell projectiles during flight.

## [MM - Enhanced Detection](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47480)
The third entry in the Magic Mechanics series, this mod adds new Oblivion-inspired visual effects and mechanics for the vanilla detection magic effects, as well as adds 7 new magic effects. It integrates those effects into new spells and distributes them in-game to spell vendors. It does all of this without requiring an ESP.

## [MM - Enhanced Telekinesis](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47534)
The fourth entry in the Magic Mechanics mod series, this mod is inspired by Fliggerty's Better Telekinesis. Using telekinesis will now propel objects towards you with special effects instead of immediately picking the item up.

## [MM - Enhanced Invisibility](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47565)
Using Invisibility now changes the way you view the world. Instead of only becoming transparent, you see through an ethereal lens that warps and twists the environment around you. Daedra and Undead feature new VFX, making them distinct from other creatures around you.

## [MM - Enhanced Light](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47672)
The light magic effect has been replaced with a Skyrim-style magelight effect. Using the new magelight effect creates an orb of light that will follow and float around you and other NPCs. Casting the magelight on a target location will create an orb of light at the location for the duration of the spell.

## [MM - Enhanced Reflection](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48956)
This mod adds reflection mechanics to the Reflect, Shield, Fire Shield, Shock Shield, and Frost Shield magic effects for both the Player and NPCs.

# Honorable Mentions
These mods are not part of the Magic Mechanics mod series, but they do add new mechanics.

## [Magicka Expanded](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47111)
If you use any of the mods above, you likely already have this mod installed. It is a requirement for most mods on this list.

This mod provides a framework to add new and fully functional magic effects to Morrowind. These effects behave just like vanilla effects: you can create new spells, enchant items, give them to companions, and treat them how any other effect would be treated.

Specifically, the Cortex spell pack adds *many* new magic mechanics that are on par with any on this list.


## [Illegal Summoning](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47105)
This mod makes it so that performing a summoning spell in a town or city is illegal, as it was originally intended to be. Performing a summoning spell and being caught while doing it will give you a bounty of 500 gold per summoning effect, per cast! If you cast a spell with 8 summoning effects, you will gain a bounty of 4000 gold. However, like with other crimes, it is possible to cast a summoning spell and not get caught. Guards will respond similarly to as if you stole an item or attacked someone.

## [The Levitation Act](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47345)
This mod makes it so that performing a levitation spell is illegal, as it is supposed to be according to The Levitation Act. 
Performing a levitation spell or using a levitation enchantment and being caught while doing so will give you a bounty of 500 gold per levitation effect, per cast! However, like with other crimes, it is possible to cast a levitation spell and not get caught. Guards will respond similarly to as if you stole an item or attacked someone. This functionality does not apply to NPCs and creatures.

## [Anchor Teleportation](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47413)
This mod makes mark and recall behave like in Daggerfall. Whenever you use recall, the location you have marked will be lost and you must cast mark again, creating an "anchor".
