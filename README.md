# Magic Mechanics
The Magic Mechanics mod series is a collection of mods that expand, improve and alter the vanilla Morrowind magic system in various ways. Mods in this series start with the abbreviation "MM" in their titles.

The mod series currently consists of the following mods:

## [MM - Cast-On-Swing Enchantments](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47338)
Another entry in the Magic Mechanics mod series, weapons with enchantments of Cast-On-Strike and Cast-On-Use types will now work without hitting a target. Just swing your weapon and the enchantment will work as normal, sending a spell projectile towards your target.

## [MM - Homing Projectiles](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47403)
Another entry in the Magic Mechanics mod series, adds the ability to control spell projectiles during flight.

## [MM - Enhanced Detection](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47480)
The third entry in the Magic Mechanics series, this mod adds new Oblivion-inspired visual effects and mechanics for the vanilla detection magic effects, as well as adds 7 new magic effects. It integrates those effects into new spells and distributes them in-game to spell vendors. It does all of this without requiring an ESP.
